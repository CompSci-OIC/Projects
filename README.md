# CIE Assembler
![view](https://github.com/CompSci-OIC/Projects/blob/master/CIE_Assembler/images/view.gif?raw=true)

There was no way to run a made up assembly code from CIE Computer Science A-Levels so we decided to make a virtual machine that could interpret this specific assembly language. It can show how RAM and relevant registers are changing in real time.

Developers:
* Adi Bozzhanov
* Laveen Chandnani
* Martin Lee
* Tanthun Assawapitiyaporn

Project leader:
* Nicholas Mulvey

## Requirements
The latest verision of tkinter has to be installed. Software was developed and tested on python 3.7

## Installation and running
Clone the repository and enter the CIE_Assembler directory
run ```python src/main.py``` or ```python3 src/main.py```
Now have fun playing around with the CIE Assembler virtual machine!
